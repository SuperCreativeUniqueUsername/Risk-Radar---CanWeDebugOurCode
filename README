Our idea was to make a device that will warn people who work outside, of potental risks they are exposed to.
The Arduino warns users of high ambient temperatures, and high sound levels

basic code for controlling the temp/humidity sensor, as well as the microphone sensor, were found online and used in our code.
we also used documentation for those parts to wire our components properly.
